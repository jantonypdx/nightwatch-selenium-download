# nightwatch-selenium-download
A simple [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) project that uses [groupon/selenium-download](https://github.com/groupon/selenium-download) package to download and run the latest compatible versions of [selenium standalone server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) for the operating system that you are running. This makes it easier to run the same Nightwatch.js tests on Mac, Windows, or Linux.
